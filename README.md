Here are three main points summarizing the Zomato Analysis project, highlighting the use of SQLite and Python:

Data Integration and Cleaning: Utilized Python and SQLite to efficiently extract, clean, and preprocess restaurant data from Zomato, ensuring data integrity and consistency for subsequent analysis. Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail in handling missing values and data anomalies.

Comprehensive Data Analysis and Visualization: Conducted extensive data analysis using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to uncover insights into restaurant ratings, online orders, and customer reviews. Created detailed visualizations, including bar charts and heatmaps, to effectively communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making.

Advanced Text and Geospatial Analysis: Implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and tokenize customer reviews, leveraging NLTK for stopword removal and tokenization. Enhanced geospatial analysis skills by integrating Folium and geopy to create interactive heatmaps, showcasing the distribution of various cuisines across different locations
Zomato Analysis
This project leverages Python and SQLite to analyze and visualize restaurant data from Zomato. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and advanced techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for customer reviews and geospatial analysis for restaurant locations. Key functionalities include:

Data Extraction and Cleaning: Extracted data from SQLite database and performed extensive cleaning to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for in-depth analysis and visualizations of restaurant ratings, online orders, and more.
Text and Geospatial Analysis: Applied NLP techniques to process customer reviews and used Folium for interactive heatmaps of restaurant locations.
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding customer preferences and trends in the restaurant industry, aiding data-driven decision-making.
